The aim is to get insights how many ppl take leaves, do work from home or work from office
By this we can get insights whether when majority ppl are available in office during which days of the week
Therefore we can organize events/parties when ppl are more and can cut some infrastructure cost when ppl leave the office
If ppl are taking sick leaves we want to understand the reason, so it can show the indication why ppl are taking leave if it is a covid like pandemic or epidemics like season flues. If we can find this pattern we can take special cautions, sanitazations, give shots of vaccines before fall season.

Data Transformation
1. Combining data from different sheets so we are trasponsing the date columns from horizontally to vertically
2. It is important that you put all the dates in one column. The give dataset had dates in different dates in different columns

example 
April-1 April-2 April-3 April-4

what we do is transpose it like
April-1
April-2
April-3
April-4
