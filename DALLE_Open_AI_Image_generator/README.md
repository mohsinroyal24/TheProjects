# Dall-E Image Generator Using OpenAI

In order to generate an Image, we have to train a neural network from scratch which will require a lot of computation power, time and money.

Open AI tools like Dall-E Image generator makes this task easier.


## Installation

1. Dowload the files and extract 
2. Open with the file with code editor (VS Code) 
3. Create a new python file named config2.py for API key and assisgn the API key generated by OpenAI ( key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" )
4. Run the main.py file
5. Open the webURL displayed in the output screen (for example:  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:81  or * Running on http://192.168.1.26:81)
6. Type whatever image you want to generate in the input.
7. Three images will be generated based on the input given by the user.
